# Public Directory

Place your 3D model file (model.glb) directly in this directory.

The ModelViewer component is set up to look for a file named `model.glb` in this public folder.

If you want to use a different file name, make sure to update the `modelUrl` prop in the `app/page.tsx` file accordingly.
